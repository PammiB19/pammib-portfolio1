      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>The objective of this report is to introduce and implement a Hydroponic NFT System designed for deployment in food pantries throughout New York. The core objective is to alleviate the prevalent shortage of fresh produce in communities relying on food pantries, concurrently fostering a sense of self-reliance by inspiring individuals to cultivate their own food. Beyond cultivating crops, this initiative seeks to actively engage the community and challenge the misconception that nutrient-rich food is exclusively reserved for the affluent. The ultimate aspiration is to democratize access to fresh produce, thereby contributing to a more sustainable and equitable food ecosystem.

      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
     <p> <b> Background/Inspiration : </b> 
      Coming from a single-parent household with limited income, my upbringing was marked by a reliance on low-nutritional, budget-friendly foods like ramen and pb&j sandwiches. Observing a parallel trend in local food pantries, I noticed a predominant focus on canned and non-perishable items. While these items offer convenience and a longer shelf life, they often lack the essential nutrition our bodies require. In my experience, fruits, particularly strawberries, were considered a luxury due to their perceived expense, resulting in infrequent consumption during my upbringing. Hence, I aim to provide  the community with fresh produce as it is my firm belief that fruits and vegetables should not be deemed luxury items but rather accessible necessities for all.
      </p>
     <p> <b> What is the problem? </b> 
      The prevalent issue at hand is the insufficient availability of nutrient-rich foods for individuals and communities facing economic challenges. This nutritional deficit particularly affects low-income households, exacerbating the struggle for access to essential nutrients.</p>

      </ol>
   
      <p><b> Factors Considered: </b>
      Ensuring safety is paramount, especially given the involvement of electrical components and water circulation in the NFT system. Furthermore, considering the possibility of occasional errors, it is imperative to establish a maintenance schedule and detailed troubleshooting procedures. Consistent checks for system components, potential blockages, and nutrient solution levels are crucial elements of this proactive approach.
      </p>
      <p> <b> Recommendations: </b>
      Recommendations involve a thorough assessment of the designated area, customizing the system based on individual preferences and requirements, and consistently maintaining and monitoring the system for optimal performance.
      </p>
      <p><b> Rationale for the suggested actions: </b>
      The support for the recommendations include training and education programs to equip individuals with essential knowledge and skills, additional resources,  and ongoing support mechanisms for continuous assistance,  adaptability and community engagement.

      <h2>Project Analysis</h2>
      <p>
      <b> Contributing Factors to the Issue: </b>
      Factors contributing to the issue encompass the absence of nutrient-rich foods in food pantries and the limited shelf life of produce after being sold at stores, which serves as a deterrent for initial donations.
      </p>
      <p><b> Strengths and Weaknesses of the Location: </b> 
      This location's strengths lie in its replicability, given the design's minimal space requirements. If a NFT system can survive in a small nyc basement, it can survive anywhere. However, the frequent foot traffic poses a challenge as it may lead to tampering with the system, a factor beyond control. and go so tampering of the system may be a factor that can't be controlled.

      <p><b> What concepts have you learned from Change Food For Good’s Intro to AgTech course apply to your case? </b>
        Participating in Change Food For Good’s Intro to AgTech course has broadened my knowledge beyond troubleshooting, sustainable practices, and food safety. The course has instilled in me a deeper understanding of the critical role planning plays in addressing community needs and identifying gaps. It emphasizes the significance of contributing not only to the well-being of the community but also to the health of our environment, which has defined how I created this system. This holistic perspective equips me with a comprehensive skill set to make a positive impact through thoughtful and sustainable initiatives.

    <section id="challenges">
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
      Throughout the project implementation, the greatest challenge faced was the consideration of pollination. Due to the indoor nature of the system, this was a great setback as strawberries require pollination for successful harvesting.
      </p>
    </section>
<br>
    <section id="solutions">
      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <p>
      To address this challenge, I conducted research and decided on utilizing a hand pollination method. This simple process essentially involves gathering pollen from the male flower using tools such as a brush or cotton swab and delicately transferring the collected pollen to the stigma of the female flower, ensuring contact with the ovule for fertilization. 
      </p>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      In conclusion, I would enhance my future processes by opting for a simpler and more adaptable system. Recognizing that the most effective home farm systems thrive on simplicity and low maintenance, I would prioritize these aspects in my approach. I emphasize the importance of not underestimating the effectiveness of simplicity. For those looking to replicate this farm system, my recommendation is to thoroughly familiarize themselves with NFT systems and carefully review the plan before assembly. A solid understanding of the fundamentals of NFT systems significantly contributes to the system's success in real-world operation. The key insights I gained revolved around the accessibility of at-home farm systems for everyone. Whether using the straightforward Kratky method or exploring other methods, growing one's food is more achievable than perceived. Encouraging individuals to cultivate their own food and understand its source is a powerful step towards transforming our food systems positively. If one by one, people begin to grow their own food and nutrients, that's how we will be able to change food for good in the end.
